# OpenAI File

:::info
The [OpenAI File is used in OpenAI Assistant API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works/creating-assistants) is still in beta.
[API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/object)
:::

Files are used to upload documents that can be used with features like Assistants and Fine-tuning.

We've implemented the File API in LangChain with create and delete.

## Creating an File

```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";
import { OpenAIFiles } from "langchain/experimental/openai_files";

const file = await OpenAIFiles.create({
  file: fs.createReadStream(path.resolve(__dirname, `./test.txt`)),
  purpose: "assistants",
});
/**
   * Output 
    {
      "id": "file-BK7bzQj3FfZFXr7DbL6xJwfo",
      "object": "file",
      "bytes": 120000,
      "created_at": 1677610602,
      "filename": "salesOverview.pdf",
      "purpose": "assistants",
    }
   */
```

## Use File in AI Assistant

```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";
import { OpenAIAssistants } from "langchain/experimental/openai_assistants";
import { OpenAIFiles } from "langchain/experimental/openai_files";

const file = await OpenAIFiles.create({
  file: fs.createReadStream(path.resolve(__dirname, `./test.txt`)),
  purpose: "assistants",
});

const agent = await OpenAIAssistantRunnable.createAssistant({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
  instructions:
    "You are a weather bot. Use the provided functions to answer questions.",
  name: "Weather Assistant",
  tools,
  asAgent: true,
  file_ids: [file.id],
});
```

## Delete an File

```typescript
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";
import { OpenAIFiles } from "langchain/experimental/openai_files";

const result = await OpenAIFiles.del({ fileId: file.id });
/**
   * Output:
   {
      "id": "file-abc123",
      "object": "file",
      "deleted": true
    }
   */
```
