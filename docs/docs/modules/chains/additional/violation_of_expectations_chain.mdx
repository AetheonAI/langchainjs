# Violation of Expectations Chain

This page demonstrates how to use the `ViolationOfExpectationsChain`, and scenarios where it can be extremely powerful for extracting insights on chat conversations.
The example provided will use a chat between a human and an AI, talking about a journal entry the user made.

The `ViolationOfExpectationsChain` was built using the findings from a paper by [Plastic Labs](https://plasticlabs.ai/). Their paper `Violation of Expectation via Metacognitive Prompting Reduces
Theory of Mind Prediction Error in Large Language Models` can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06983).
